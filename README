These are some Linux config files (a.k.a. dotfiles) for my Arch Linux (x86) system. Main shell is zsh, main window manager is XMonad (darcs), designed for a 1920x1200px (26") monitor. Icon sets are also included. – For first impressions look at my dA gallery: http://mitoxd.deviantart.com/gallery/45852735

Have fun! ^^
